# winnipegr

This R package provides an abstraction layer for easily accessing openly available data sets for Winnipeg, MB, Canada. It includes the following functions for downloading data:

- `wpg_weather` for sourcing Winnipeg weather from stations from: Winnipeg 'CXWI', Winnipeg Forks 'CXWN', and Winnipeg International Airport 'CYWG'.
- `get_WPA_Stations` for sourcing available WPA parking station variables such as `available_space`, `hourly_rate`, `timelimit`, location, and others.


## Installation

In the future, you will be able to install the released version of winnipegr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("winnipegr")
```

But, for now you need to use `devtools`:
``` r
install_github("jdallmann/winnipegr")
```
